# [yonks][yonks]

A small tool for planning the social media posts that you'll publish over the
next week or so. I made this for [my wife][wife], who until now was using a
spreadsheet to accomplish this.

It's built using [create-react-app][cra] with some
[styled-components][sc] mixed in. The app works offline, and
posts are persisted to local storage.
